Complete the table below with your results, and then provide your interpretation at the end.

Note that:

- When calculating the parallel speed-up S, use the time output by the code, which corresponds
  to the parallel calculation and does not include initialising the matrix/vectors or
  performing the serial check.

- Take as the serial execution time the time output by the code when run with a single process
  (hence the speed-up for 1 process should be 1.0).


No. Process:    Mean time (average of 3 runs):    Parallel speed-up, S:    Efficiency, E(%)
